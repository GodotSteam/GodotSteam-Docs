### Sponsors Repo
Donors get access to our private Sponsors repository which contains in-the-works versions of GodotSteam and other related projects. A beta key to Skillet is also provided to all active donors prior to the game's release.

### Documentation Listing
Everyone gets added to our documentation's contributor list and one link is permitted per donor. [You may have to e-mail us at donors@godotsteam.com](mailto:donors@godotsteam.com){ target="\_blank" } as your contact information isn't shared with us through GitHub Sponsors.

### Discord Roles
We have to manually add you in the Discord server, if you are a sponsor. Just reach out to one of the moderators to get your role!

### Shout-Outs
Shout-outs on Discord and socials happen in bulk every so often.

### Logos On Website
Front page logos get coordinated through e-mail for donors over a certain amount.

### Pair-Programming
1-on-1 pair-programming sessions should be reserved to more serious issues.  [If you are eligible for these, please contact Gramps by e-mail to discuss a schedule and topic.](mailto:gramps@godotsteam.com){ target="\_blank" }

### Direct Support
Direct support for sponsors can also be had through [contacting us at donors@godotsteam.com too.](mailto:donors@godotsteam.com){ target="\_blank" }
