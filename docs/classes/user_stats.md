### attachLeaderboardUGC

!!! function "attachLeaderboardUGC( ```uint64_t``` ugc_handle, ```uint64_t``` this_leaderboard )"
	If no this_leaderboard is passed, then the function will use the last internally-stored handle.

	Attaches a piece of user generated content the current user's entry on a leaderboard.

	This content could be a replay of the user achieving the score or a ghost to race against. The attached handle will be available when the entry is retrieved and can be accessed by other users using the [leaderboard_scores_downloaded](#leaderboard_scores_downloaded) callback. To create and download user generated content see the documentation for the Steam Workshop.

	Once attached, the content will be available even if the underlying Cloud file is changed or deleted by the user.

	You must call [findLeaderboard](#findleaderboard) or [findOrCreateLeaderboard](#findorcreateleaderboard) to get a leaderboard handle prior to calling this function.

	Triggers a [leaderboard_ugc_set](#leaderboard_ugc_set) callback.

	**Returns:** void

### clearAchievement

!!! function "clearAchievement( ```string``` name )"
	Resets the unlock status of an achievement.

	This is primarily only ever used for testing.
	
	You must have called [requestCurrentStats](#requestcurrentstats) and it needs to return successfully via its callback prior to calling this.

	This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state so it is quite cheap. To send the unlock status to the server and to trigger the Steam overlay notification you must call [storeStats](#storestats).

	**Returns:** bool

### downloadLeaderboardEntries

!!! function "downloadLeaderboardEntries( ```int``` start, ```int``` end, ```int``` type, ```uint64_t``` this_leaderboard )"
	If no leaderboard_handle is passed, then the function will use the last internally-stored handle.

	Fetches a series of leaderboard entries for a specified leaderboard.

	You can ask for more entries than exist, then this will return as many as do exist.

	If you want to download entries for an arbitrary set of users, such as all of the users on a server then you can use [downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers](#downloadleaderboardentriesforusers) which takes an array of Steam IDs.

	You must call [findLeaderboard](#findleaderboard) or [findOrCreateLeaderboard](#findorcreateleaderboard) to get a leaderboard handle prior to calling this function.

	Triggers a [leaderboard_scores_downloaded](#leaderboard_scores_downloaded) call result.

	**Returns:** void

### downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers

!!! function "downloadLeaderboardEntriesForUsers( ```array``` users_id, ```uint64_t``` this_leaderboard )"
	If no leaderboard_handle is passed, then the function will use the last internally-stored handle.

	Fetches leaderboard entries for an arbitrary set of users on a specified leaderboard.

	A maximum of 100 users can be downloaded at a time, with only one outstanding call at a time. If a user doesn't have an entry on the specified leaderboard, they won't be included in the result.

	If you want to download entries based on their ranking or friends of the current user then you should use [downloadLeaderboardEntries](#downloadleaderboardentries).

	You must call [findLeaderboard](#findleaderboard) or [findOrCreateLeaderboard](#findorcreateleaderboard) to get a leaderboard handle prior to calling this function.

	Triggers a [leaderboard_scores_downloaded](#leaderboard_scores_downloaded) callback.

	**Returns:** void

### findLeaderboard

!!! function "findLeaderboard( ```string``` name )"

	Triggers a [leaderboard_find_result](#leaderboard_find_result) call result.

	**Returns:** void

    ---

### findOrCreateLeaderboard

!!! function "findOrCreateLeaderboard( ```string``` name, ```int``` sort_method, ```int``` display_type )"
	Gets a leaderboard by name, it will create it if it's not yet created.

	You must call either this or [findLeaderboard](#findleaderboard) to obtain the leaderboard handle which is valid for the game session for each leaderboard you wish to access prior to calling any other Leaderboard functions.

	Leaderboards created with this function will not automatically show up in the Steam Community. You must manually set the Community Name field in the App Admin panel of the Steamworks website. As such it's generally recommended to prefer creating the leaderboards in the App Admin panel on the Steamworks website and using [findLeaderboard](#findleaderboard) unless you're expected to have a large amount of dynamically created leaderboards.

	You should never pass 0 for sort_method or 0 for display_type as this is undefined behavior.
	
	Triggers a [leaderboard_find_result](#leaderboard_find_result) callback.
	
	**Returns:** void

### setAchievement

!!! function "setAchievement( ```string``` name )"
	Unlocks an achievement.

	You must have called [requestCurrentStats](#requestcurrentstats) and it needs to return successfully via its callback prior to calling this!

	You can unlock an achievement multiple times so you don't need to worry about only setting achievements that aren't already set. This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state so it is quite cheap. To send the unlock status to the server and to trigger the Steam overlay notification you must call [storeStats](#storestats).

	**Returns:** bool

	If this is returning false and everything appears correct, then check to ensure that your changes in the App Admin panel of the Steamworks website are published.

	**Returns:** bool

	This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state and is very cheap. Doing so allows Steam to persist the changes even in the event of a game crash or unexpected shutdown. To submit the stats to the server you must call [storeStats](#storestats).

	If this is returning false and everything appears correct, then check to ensure that your changes in the App Admin panel of the Steamworks website are published.

	**Returns:** bool

### storeStats

!!! function "storeStats()"
	Send the changed stats and achievements data to the server for permanent storage.

	If this fails then nothing is sent to the server. It's advisable to keep trying until the call is successful.

	This call can be rate limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds. You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing, or the user leaving a server. This call is required to display the achievement unlock notification dialog though, so if you have called [setAchievement](#setachievement) then it's advisable to call this soon after that.

	If you have stats or achievements that you have saved locally but haven't uploaded with this function when your application process ends then this function will automatically be called.

	You can find additional debug information written to the ```%steam_install%\logs\stats_log.txt``` file.

	Triggers a [user_stats_stored](#user_stats_stored) callback.

	Triggers a [user_achievement_stored](#user_achievement_stored) callback.

	**Returns:** bool

### updateAvgRateStat

!!! function "updateAvgRateStat( ```string``` name, ```float``` this_session, ```double``` session_length )"
	Updates an AVGRATE stat with new values.

	You must have called [requestCurrentStats](#requestcurrentstats) and it needs to return successfully via its callback prior to calling this!

	This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state and is very cheap. Doing so allows Steam to persist the changes even in the event of a game crash or unexpected shutdown. To submit the stats to the server you must call [storeStats](#storestats).

### uploadLeaderboardScore

!!! function "uploadLeaderboardScore( ```int32``` score, ```bool``` keep_best, ```array``` details, ```uint64_t``` this_leaderboard )"
	If this_leaderboard is not passed, then the function will use the last internally-stored handle.

	Uploads a user score to a specified leaderboard.
	
	Details are optional game-defined information which outlines how the user got that score. For example if it's a racing style time based leaderboard you could store the timestamps when the player hits each checkpoint. If you have collectibles along the way you could use bit fields as booleans to store the items the player picked up in the playthrough.

	Uploading scores to Steam is rate limited to 10 uploads per 10 minutes and you may only have one outstanding call to this function at a time.
	
	Triggers a [leaderboard_score_uploaded](#leaderboard_score_uploaded) callback.

	**Returns:** void
