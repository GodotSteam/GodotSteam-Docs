### clearUserAchievement

!!! function "clearUserAchievement( ```uint64_t``` steam_id, ```string``` name )"
	Resets the unlock status of an achievement for the specified user. This is primarily only ever used for testing. You must have called [requestUserStats](#requestuserstats) and it needs to return successfully via its callback prior to calling this. This call only modifies Steam's in-memory state and is very cheap. To submit the stats to the server you must call [storeUserStats](#storeuserstats).

	**Returns:** bool

	**Note:** This will work only on achievements that game servers are allowed to set. If the "Set By" field for this achievement is "Official GS" then only game servers that have been declared as officially controlled by you will be able to set it. To do this you must set the IP range of your official servers in the [Dedicated Servers](https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/dedicatedservers/){ target="_blank" } section of App Admin.

You can find additional debug information written to the ```%steam_install%\logs\stats_log.txt``` file.
