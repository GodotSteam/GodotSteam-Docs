# HTTP

A small and easy to use HTTP client to send and receive data from the web.

!!! info "Only available in the main [GodotSteam branches](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam){ target="\_blank" } and [GodotSteam Server branches](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam-Server){ target="\_blank" }"

### createCookieContainer

!!! function "createCookieContainer( ```bool``` allow_responses_to_modify )"
	Creates a cookie container to store cookies during the lifetime of the process. This API is just for during process lifetime, after Steam restarts no cookies are persisted and you have no way to access the cookie container across repeat executions of your process.

	If **allow_responses_to_modify** is true then any response to your requests using this cookie container may add new cookies to the container which may be transmitted with future requests. Otherwise, if it's false then only cookies you explicitly set will be sent.

	You can associate the cookie container with a http request by using [setHTTPRequestCookieContainer](#sethttprequestcookiecontainer), and you can set a cookie using [setHTTPCookie](#sethttpcookie). Don't forget to free the container when you're done with it to prevent leaking memory by calling [releaseCookieContainer](#releasecookiecontainer)!
	
	**Returns:** uint32_t

### createHTTPRequest

!!! function "createHTTPRequest( ```int``` request_method, ```string``` absolute_url )"

	Initializes a new HTTP request. Requires the method such as GET or POST and the absolute URL for the request. Both http and https are supported, so this string must start with "http://" or "https://" and should look like "http://store.steampowered.com/app/10/" or similar. This call returns a handle that you can use to make further calls to setup and then send the HTTP request with [sendHTTPRequest](#sendhttprequest) or [sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse](#sendhttprequestandstreamresponse). Don't forget to free the HTTP request when you're done with it to prevent leaking memory by calling [releaseHTTPRequest](#releasehttprequest).

	**Returns:** uint32_t

### getHTTPDownloadProgressPct

!!! function "getHTTPDownloadProgressPct( ```uint32``` request_handle )"
	Gets progress on downloading the body for the request. This will be zero unless a response header has already been received which included a content-length field. For responses that contain no content-length it will report zero for the duration of the request as the size is unknown until the connection closes.

	**Returns:** float

### getHTTPRequestWasTimedOut

!!! function "getHTTPRequestWasTimedOut( ```int``` request_handle )"
	Check if the reason the request failed was because we timed it out (rather than some harder failure). You'll want to call this within the context of [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) callback if **request_success** is false.

	**Returns:** bool

### getHTTPResponseBodyData

!!! function "getHTTPResponseBodyData( ```uint32``` request_handle, ```uint32``` buffer_size )"
	Gets the body data from an HTTP response. This must be called after the HTTP request has completed and returned the HTTP response via the [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) call result associated with this request handle. You should first call [getHTTPResponseBodySize](#gethttpresponsebodysize) or use the **body_size** variable provided in the call result, you can then allocate a buffer with that size to pass into this function.
	This is only for HTTP requests which were sent with [sendHTTPRequest](#sendhttprequest). Use [getHTTPStreamingResponseBodyData](#gethttpstreamingresponsebodydata) if you're using streaming HTTP requests via [sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse](#sendhttprequestandstreamresponse).

	**Returns:** PoolByteArray

### getHTTPResponseBodySize

!!! function "getHTTPResponseBodySize( ```uint32``` request_handle )"
	Gets the size of the body data from an HTTP response. This must be called after the HTTP request has completed and returned the HTTP response via the [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) or [http_request_data_received](#http_request_data_received) associated with this request handle. If this returns successfully, then you can allocate a buffer with the provided size to fill with the data obtained from [getHTTPResponseBodyData](#gethttpresponsebodydata) or [getHTTPStreamingResponseBodyData](#gethttpstreamingresponsebodydata).

	**Returns:** uint32

### getHTTPResponseHeaderSize

!!! function "getHTTPResponseHeaderSize( ```uint32``` request_handle, ```string``` header_name )"
	Checks if a header is present in an HTTP response and returns its size. This must be called after the HTTP request has completed and returned the HTTP response via the [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) call result associated with this request handle. If the response header exists in the response, then you can allocate a correctly sized buffer to get the associated value with [getHTTPResponseHeaderValue](#gethttpresponseheadervalue). Here is a list of standard response header names on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields){ target="\_blank" }.

### getHTTPResponseHeaderValue

!!! function "getHTTPResponseHeaderValue( ```uint32``` request_handle, ```string``` header_name, ```uint32``` buffer_size )"
	Gets a header value from an HTTP response. This must be called after the HTTP request has completed and returned the HTTP response via the [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) call result associated with this request handle. You should first call [getHTTPResponseHeaderSize](#gethttpresponseheadersize) to check for the presence of the header and to get the size. You can then allocate a buffer with that size and pass it into this function. Here is a list of standard response header names on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Response_fields){ target="\_blank" }.

	**Returns:** PackedByteArray (4.x) / PoolByteArray (3.x)

### getHTTPStreamingResponseBodyData

!!! function "getHTTPStreamingResponseBodyData( ```uint32``` request_handle, ```uint32``` offset, ```uint32``` buffer_size )"
	Gets the body data from a streaming HTTP response. This must be called after data is received from a streaming HTTP request via the [http_request_completed](#http_request_completed) callback associated with this request handle. Typically you'll want to allocate a buffer associated with the request handle using the Content-Length HTTP response field to receive the total size of the data when you receive the header via [http_request_headers_received](#http_request_headers_received). You can then append data to that buffer as it comes in. This is only for streaming HTTP requests which were sent with [sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse](#sendhttprequestandstreamresponse). Use [getHTTPResponseBodyData](#gethttpresponsebodydata) if you're using [sendHTTPRequest](#sendhttprequest).

	**Returns:** PackedByteArray (4.x) / PoolByteArray (3.x)

    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamHTTP#ReleaseHTTPRequest){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### sendHTTPRequest

!!! function "sendHTTPRequest( ```uint32``` request_handle )"		
	Sends an HTTP request. This call is asynchronous and provides a call result handle which you must use to track the call to its completion. If you have multiple requests in flight at the same time you can use [prioritizeHTTPRequest](#prioritizehttprequest) or [deferHTTPRequest](#deferhttprequest) to set the priority of the request.

	If the user is in offline mode in Steam, then this will add an only-if-cached cache-control header and only do a local cache lookup rather than sending any actual remote request.

	If the data you are expecting is large, you can use [sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse](#sendhttprequestandstreamresponse) to stream the data in chunks.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamHTTP#SendHTTPRequest){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse

!!! function "sendHTTPRequestAndStreamResponse( ```uint32``` request_handle )"		
	Sends an HTTP request and streams the response back in chunks. This call is asynchronous and provides a call result handle which you must use to track the call to its completion. Typically you'll want to allocate a buffer associated with the request handle using the Content-Length HTTP response field to receive the total size of the data when you receive the header via [http_request_headers_received](#http_request_headers_received). You can then append data to that buffer as it comes in.

	If you have multiple requests in flight at the same time you can use [prioritizeHTTPRequest](#prioritizehttprequest) or [deferHTTPRequest](#deferhttprequest) to set the priority of the request.

	If the user is in offline mode in Steam, then this will add an only-if-cached cache-control header and only do a local cache lookup rather than sending any actual remote request.

	If the data you are expecting is small (on the order of a few megabytes or less) then you'll likely want to use [sendHTTPRequest](#sendhttprequest).

	**Returns:** bool
