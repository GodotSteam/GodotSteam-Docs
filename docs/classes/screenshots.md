### hookScreenshots

!!! function "hookScreenshots( ```bool``` hook )"

    Toggles whether the overlay handles screenshots when the user presses the screenshot hotkey, or if the game handles them. 
  
	Hooking is disabled by default, and only ever enabled if you do so with this function. 
  
	If the hooking is enabled, then the [screenshot_requested](#screenshot_requested) callback will be sent if the user presses the hotkey or when [triggerScreenshot](#triggerscreenshot) is called. Then the game is expected to call [writeScreenshot](#writescreenshot) or [addScreenshotToLibrary](#addscreenshottolibrary) in response. 
 
	You can check if hooking is enabled with [isScreenshotsHooked](#isscreenshotshooked).

    **Returns:** void

You can get the handle to tag the screenshot once it has been successfully saved from the [screenshot_ready](#screenshot_ready) callback or via the [WriteScreenshot](#writescreenshot), [AddScreenshotToLibrary](#addscreenshottolibrary), [AddVRScreenshotToLibrary](#addvrscreenshottolibrary) calls.
