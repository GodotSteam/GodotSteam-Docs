	Triggers a [lobby_data_update](#lobby_data_update) callback.

	**Returns:** bool

	_True_ if the request was successfully sent to the server. _False_ if no connection to Steam could be made, or **steam_lobby_id** is invalid.

### requestLobbyList

!!! function "requestLobbyList()"
	Get a filtered list of relevant lobbies.

	There can only be one active lobby search at a time. The old request will be canceled if a new one is started. Depending on the user's connection to the Steam back-end, this call can take from 300ms to 5 seconds to complete, and has a timeout of 20 seconds.

	Triggers a [lobby_match_list](#lobby_match_list) callback.

	**Returns:** void

	**Note:** To filter the results you _must_ call the **addRequestLobbyList** functions before calling this. The filters are cleared on each call to this function.

	**Note:** If [addRequestLobbyListDistanceFilter](#addrequestlobbylistdistancefilter) is not called, **[LOBBY_DISTANCE_FILTER_DEFAULT (1)](#lobbydistancefilter)** will be used, which will only find matches in the same or nearby regions.

	**Note:** This will only return lobbies that are not full, and only lobbies that are **[LOBBY_TYPE_PUBLIC (2)](#lobbytype)** or **[LOBBY_TYPE_INVISIBLE (3)](#lobbytype)**, and are set to joinable with [setLobbyJoinable](#setlobbyjoinable).

### sendLobbyChatMsg

!!! function "sendLobbyChatMsg( ```uint64_t``` steam_lobby_id, ```string``` message_body )"
	Broadcasts a chat (text or binary data) message to the all of the users in the lobby.
	All users in the lobby (including the local user) will receive a [lobby_message](#lobby_message) callback with the message.

	For communication that needs to be arbitrated (for example having a user pick from a set of characters, and making sure only one user has picked a character), you can use the lobby owner as the decision maker. [getLobbyOwner](#getlobbyowner) returns the current lobby owner. There is guaranteed to always be one and only one lobby member who is the owner. So for the choose-a-character scenario, the user who is picking a character would send the binary message 'I want to be Zoe', the lobby owner would see that message, see if it was OK, and broadcast the appropriate result (user X is Zoe).

	These messages are sent via the Steam back-end, and so the bandwidth available is limited. For higher-volume traffic like voice or game data, you'll want to use the Steam Networking API.

	Triggers a [lobby_message](#lobby_message) callback.

	**Returns:** bool

	This can only be set by the owner of the lobby. Lobby members should use [setLobbyMemberData](#setlobbymemberdata) instead.

	Each user in the lobby will be receive notification of the lobby data change via a [lobby_data_update](#lobby_data_update) callback, and any new users joining will receive any existing data.

	This will only send the data if it has changed. There is a slight delay before sending the data so you can call this repeatedly to set all the data you need to and it will automatically be batched up and sent after the last sequential call.
	
	**Returns:** bool

	_True_ if the data has been set successfully. _False_ if **steam_lobby_id** was invalid, or the key/value are too long.

	**Returns:** bool

	_True_ upon success; otherwise, _false_ if you're not the owner of the lobby.

	Emits signal in response to function [requestLobbyList](#requestlobbylist).

	**Returns:**

	* lobbies (array) as lobby IDs (uint64_t)

	**Notes:** With the GDNative plug-in, this callback will also send back the lobby count as an integer; this fixes a very strange issue with GDNative mangling the lobbies array.
