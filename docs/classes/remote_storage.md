# Remote Storage

Provides functions for reading, writing, and accessing files which can be stored remotely in the Steam Cloud. See [Steam Cloud](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloud){ target="\_blank" } for more information.

!!! info "Only available in the main [GodotSteam branches](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam){ target="\_blank" }"

### beginFileWriteBatch

!!! function "beginFileWriteBatch()"
	Use this along with [endFileWriteBatch](#endfilewritebatch) to wrap a set of local file writes/deletes that should be considered part of one single state change. For example, if saving game progress requires updating both savegame1.dat and maxprogress.dat, wrap those operations with calls to [beginFileWriteBatch](#beginfilewritebatch) and [endFileWriteBatch](#endfilewritebatch).

	These functions provide a hint to Steam which will help it manage the app's Cloud files. Using these functions is optional, however it will provide better reliability.

	Note that the functions may be used whether the writes are done using the Remote Storage API, or done directly to local disk (where AutoCloud is used).

	**Returns:** bool

### endFileWriteBatch

!!! function "endFileWriteBatch()"
	Use this along with [beginFileWriteBatch](#beginfilewritebatch) - see that documentation for more details.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#EndFileWriteBatch){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileDelete

!!! function "fileDelete( ```string``` file )"
	Deletes a file from the local disk, and propagates that delete to the cloud.

	This is meant to be used when a user actively deletes a file. Use [fileForget](#fileforget) if you want to remove a file from the Steam Cloud but retain it on the users local disk.

	When a file has been deleted it can be re-written with [fileWrite](#filewrite) to reupload it to the Steam Cloud.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileDelete){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileExists

!!! function "fileExists( ```string``` file )"
	Check if a remote file exists.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileExists){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileForget

!!! function "fileForget( ```string``` file )"
	Deletes the file from remote storage, but leaves it on the local disk and remains accessible from the API.

	When you are out of Cloud space, this can be used to allow calls to [fileWrite](#filewrite) to keep working without needing to make the user delete files.

	How you decide which files to forget are up to you. It could be a simple Least Recently Used (LRU) queue or something more complicated.

	Requiring the user to manage their Cloud-ized files for a game, while it is possible to do, is never recommended. For instance, "Which file would you like to delete so that you may store this new one?" removes a significant advantage of using the Cloud in the first place: its transparency.
	
	Once a file has been deleted or forgotten, calling [fileWrite](#filewrite) will resynchronize it in the Cloud. Rewriting a forgotten file is the only way to make it persisted again.

	**Returns:** bool

	- **true** if the file exists and has been successfully forgotten; otherwise, **false**.

	Checks if a specific file is persisted in the Steam Cloud.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FilePersisted){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileRead

!!! function "fileRead( ```string``` file, ```uint32_t``` data_to_read )"
	Opens a binary file, reads the contents of the file into a byte array, and then closes the file.

	**Returns:** dictionary

	Contains the following keys:

	* ret (bool)
	* buf (PoolByteArray)

	**Note:**  This is a synchronous call and as such is a will block your calling thread on the disk IO, and will also block the SteamAPI, which can cause other threads in your application to block. To avoid "hitching" due to a busy disk on the client machine using [fileReadAsync](#filereadasync), the asynchronous version of this API is recommended.

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileRead){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileReadAsync

!!! function "fileReadAsync( ```string``` file, ```uint32``` offset, ```uint32_t``` data_to_read )"
	Starts an asynchronous read from a file. The offset and amount to read should be valid for the size of the file, as indicated by [getFileSize](#getfilesize) or [getFileTimestamp](#getfiletimestamp).

	Triggers a [file_read_async_complete](#file_read_async_complete) call result.

	**Returns:** void

### fileWrite

!!! function "fileWrite( ```string``` file, ```PoolByteArray``` data )"
	Creates a new file, writes the bytes to the file, and then closes the file. If the target file already exists, it is overwritten.

	**Returns:** bool

	**Note:**  This is a synchronous call and as such is a will block your calling thread on the disk IO, and will also block the SteamAPI, which can cause other threads in your application to block. To avoid "hitching" due to a busy disk on the client machine using [fileWriteAsync](#filewriteasync), the asynchronous version of this API is recommended.

### fileWriteStreamCancel

!!! function "fileWriteStreamCancel( ```uint64_t``` write_handle )"
	Cancels a file write stream that was started by [fileWriteStreamOpen](#filewritestreamopen).

	This trashes all of the data written and closes the write stream, but if there was an existing file with this name, it remains untouched.

	**Returns:** bool

	This flushes the stream to the disk, overwriting the existing file if there was one.

	**Returns:** bool

    ---
    [:fontawesome-brands-steam: Read more in the official Steamworks SDK documentation](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamRemoteStorage#FileWriteStreamClose){ .md-button .md-button--store target="_blank" }

### fileWriteStreamOpen

!!! function "fileWriteStreamOpen( ```string``` file )"
	Creates a new file output stream allowing you to stream out data to the Steam Cloud file in chunks. If the target file already exists, it is not overwritten until [fileWriteStreamClose](#filewritestreamclose) has been called.

	To write data out to this stream you can use [fileWriteStreamWriteChunk](#filewritestreamwritechunk), and then to close or cancel you use [fileWriteStreamClose](#filewritestreamclose) and [fileWriteStreamCancel](#filewritestreamcancel) respectively.

	**Returns:** uint64_t

### getLocalFileChange

!!! function "getLocalFileChange( ```int``` file )"
	After calling [getLocalFileChangeCount](#getlocalfilechangecount), use this method to iterate over the changes. The changes described have already been made to local files. Your application should take appropriate action to reload state from disk, and possibly notify the user.
	
	For example: The local system had been suspended, during which time the user played elsewhere and uploaded changes to the Steam Cloud. On resume, Steam downloads those changes to the local system before resuming the application. The application receives an [local_file_changed](#local_file_changed), and uses [getLocalFileChangeCount](#getlocalfilechangecount) and [getLocalFileChange](#getlocalfilechange) to iterate those changes. Depending on the application structure and the nature of the changes, the application could:
	
	* Re-load game progress to resume at exactly the point where the user was when they exited the game on the other device
	* Notify the user of any synchronized changes that don't require reloading
	* Etc.
		
	**Returns:** dictionary

	Contains the following keys:

	* file (string)
	* change_type (int)
	* path_type (int)

	**Note:** only applies to applications flagged as supporting dynamic Steam Cloud sync.

### getLocalFileChangeCount

!!! function "getLocalFileChangeCount()"
	When your application receives a [local_file_changed](#local_file_changed), use this method to get the number of changes (file updates and file deletes) that have been made. You can then iterate the changes using [getLocalFileChange](#getlocalfilechange).

	**Returns:** uint32_t

	**Note:** only applies to applications flagged as supporting dynamic Steam Cloud sync.
