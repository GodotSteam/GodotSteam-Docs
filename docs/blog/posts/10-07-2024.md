# First Post Is The Best Post

OK, here we go... the first news post for GodotSteam.  A good place to keep all the updates and such for the project.

{==
## :simple-steam: Steamworks SDK 1.60
==}

There is a new SDK with functions for the Game Recording beta features Valve just rolled out.  It also has some updates to UGC and other little bits.  These changes are now live in GodotSteam 4.9 (Godot 4.x / GDExtension / MultiplayerPeer) as well as GodotSteam 3.26 (Godot  3.x / GDNative).

The docs haven't been fully updated for it yet though; nor have the in-editor docs for pre-compiled module versions.  That should be coming in another, smaller patch soon.

## :simple-godotengine: GodotSteam Components
==}

Finally, our first update about GodotSteam Components.  The first round of tools will be:

- SteamAchievementIcon node
- Inventory Item Editor
- Steamworks VDF Editor
- SteamLobby node
- SteamChat node

You can check out the Projects page for it to find more details about what will be available and what all is planned.  Github Sponsors will get access to it in September and public roll-out will happen sometime in the following months.

## :material-gamepad-variant: Skillet Updates
==}

Skillet is coming along nicely and the public repo should be available sometime in October. The store page should be live in August, with the game finally releasing in early December of this year!

Development sessions happen each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on our Discord channel. Starts around noon CST and runs for about three hours; when it is not canceled.

Hopefully soon there will be something interesting enough to show.
