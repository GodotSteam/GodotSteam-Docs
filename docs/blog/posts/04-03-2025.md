# Godot 4.4 and GodotSteam 4.13

Hey, gang!  So Godot 4.4 was just released yesterday and we are now rolling out versions of GodotSteam 4.13 too! The Godot 4 pre-compiles, GDExtension, and MultiplayerPeer have been updated and are now available on [Github in the release section](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases/tag/v4.13){ target="\_blank" }, linked through the website, or [on the Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2445){ target="\_blank" }; well, at least for GDExtension.

Github Actions still has not been fully updated to create Angle and Direct3D versions yet so that will take a bit more time but are expected to be released (hopefully) this week.  The Server builds will also be updated for Godot 4.4 but that won't be until tomorrow.

[For the full list of changes, check out the change-log for Godot 4.](../changelog/godot4)
