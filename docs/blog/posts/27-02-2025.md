# Exporting? Shipping? Yes!

{==
## :simple-godotengine: Getting Your Game Exported And On Steam
==}

Hey, gang! A few days ago we released an updated text tutorial that goes into more details on the process of exporting your game from Godot, setting up some basic things in the Steamworks partner site, and then shipping the game to Steam.  [Today, we are releasing the video version of that text tutorial on MakerTube.](https://makertube.net/w/aExfBFQikyUsXJMCkKhSc5){ target="\_blank" }

You can also [find the tutorial on the Godot Barn!](https://thegodotbarn.com/contributions/tutorial/249/godotsteam-tutorials-exporting-and-shipping){ target="\_blank" }

As usual, there will probably be some tweaks and updates to this over time.  A new video tutorial, and updated text tutorial, will be out next month; this time covering Statistics and Achievements.
