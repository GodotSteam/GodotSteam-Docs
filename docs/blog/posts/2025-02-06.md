# Server Updates; No, GodotSteam Server

Today I pushed through what seems like a small change-log worth of fixes but, under the hood, was actually a lot of fixes for all classes available in the GodotSteam Server branches.  Thankfully, a user, Michael Janeway, found that many of the class functions were linked incorrectly to the non-server versions and causing issues.  After a pull-request and then combing through the rest of the functions, everything is now sorted out.

If you are using the server branches, now would be a great time to download the new versions on [the Github releases page](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam-Server/releases){ target="\_blank" } or the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2218){ target="\_blank" }.  All branches (Godot 4.x, Godot 3.x, and GDExtension) have been updated; since the GDNative version was deprecated, however, it will not get updated.
