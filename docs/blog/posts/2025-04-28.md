# GodotSteam 4.15 Out Now

Both the pre-compiled module and GDExtension versions got updated today to mainly fix the embedded callbacks issue in 4.14.  Now you should be able to correctly use it both through the Project Settings option or when passing true to steamInit or steamInitEx.  Apparently trying to bind it to the \_process function does not work with an object.  There were some other small changes and updates; mostly some missing functions or minor tweaks.  As I've been creeping from Steam class to Steam class to get our documentation updated, I have found a few things that got overlooked.  Currently I'm only at Users / User Stats so there maybe be another chunk coming for 4.16.  Including finally porting over all the Flat API changes.

Keen eyes may notice that the 4.1-4.3 version of the GDExtension is now deprecated. This last update fixes the embedded callback portion and that will be the last update 4.3 or earlier gets.

More coming soon!
