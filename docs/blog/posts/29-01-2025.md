# Website Upgrades

Today we roll out a revamped layout for the documentation website to make it a bit more organized and hopefully easier to navigate. Literally every page has been given a bit of a facelift with a lot more changes coming soon.  Expect to see all our of tutorials get updated with new ones on the horizon; paired with [new video tutorials which will be on the MakerTube page.](https://makertube.net/c/making_____with_godotsteam/videos){ target="\_blank" }

I also plan to do a fine-tooth comb over all the rest of the pages like classes and how-to's to make sure everything is updated correctly, then go through all the pins we have on Discord about various things that need added or corrected.  But at least this first big step into the new docs is finished.

Surely, as with every update, there are probably some minor issues and misspelling. Please feel free to open a pull-request or toss out an e-mail with whatever you find.

:heart: Love, Gramps
