# Servers 4.5.2 and 3.5.1

Seems like we just updated the servers not too long ago and now there is a new patch to fix an apparently long-standing glitch which caused the servers to crash any time IP addresses were converted internally.

The functions now use a somewhat rolled back method from a few versions ago which seems to work good.

Everything has been pushed public and things are compiled and ready to go!  You can find the [Godot 4 server here](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam-Server/releases/tag/v4.5.2){ target="\_blank" } and the [Godot 3 server here](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam-Server/releases/tag/v3.5.1){ target="\_blank" }, with the [GDExtension version on the Godot Asset Library.](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2218){ target="\_blank" }

These IP conversion functions will get backported to the standard branches soon too.
